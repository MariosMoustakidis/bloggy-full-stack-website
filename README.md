A blog site where admins can upload articles.
The admin can also edit and remove his articles from the website.

Users can also register to comment on the articles.
Every user's password is stored using hashing and salts for safety.

The site is created with flask. I have used flask_bootstrap, flask_ckeditor for writing the articles and flask_sqlalchemy for the database and the relationships between the data.
The site utilizes a postgreSQL database for storing the data.
