A blog site where admins can upload articles.

If you want to try to upload an article you can log in with Username: admin and Password: admin.
The admin can also edit and remove his articles from the website.

Users can also register to comment on the articles.
Every user's password is stored using hashing and salts for safety.

The contact form is currently disabled because render.com where the site is hosted is blocking SMTP. I am looking to send emails through an API in the future to make the contect form usable on render.com.

The site is created with flask. I have used flask_bootstrap, flask_ckeditor for writing the articles and flask_sqlalchemy for the database and the relationships between the data.
The site utilizes a postgreSQL database for storing the data.

You can find my info on the about section as well as my CV.
